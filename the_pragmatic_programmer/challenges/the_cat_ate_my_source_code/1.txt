Question: How do you react when someone-such as a bank teller, an auto
mechanic, or a clerk comes to you with a lame excuse? What do you think of
them and their company as a result?

Answer: I feel very angry when someone provide a lame excuse. I don't satisfy
and feel I am getting worst service in-return of provided money. Such things
are important to consider when someone is taking my service. In addition, such
lame answers are obvious when other party is not much aware with the concepts.
One has to resonate if the other party is having knowledge of the subject. I
looks unobvious to deliver certain task late because your unfamiliarity with
tool. Then what to do in a situation where you are not familiar with the tool
and deadline is short?
