Question: While reviewing a draft of this book. John Lakos raised the
following issue: The soldiers progressively deceive the villagers, but the
change they catalyze does them all good. However, by progressively deceiving
the frog, you're doing it harm. Can you determine whether you're making stone
soup or frog soup when you try to catalyze change? Is the decision subjective
or objective?


Answer: While trying to catalyze the change, the author is making a stone soup
because the process of catalyzing will expect interest of others. The decision
is subjective in my opinion because the concepts, things are more clear in
one's head. It might be possible that those are not expected by others.
